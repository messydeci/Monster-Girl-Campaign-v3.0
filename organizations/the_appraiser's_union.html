<h2>
General Description
</h2>

<p>
With only their single location in Bavlo, the Appraiser's Union operates a communications network across broad swaths of the Weeping Reaches, including working with a number of Bavlovian guilds, with the aim of providing seals of approval and certifications of grade for a huge variety of goods. Though small in number, the network of contacts cultivated by the union is an invaluable asset to crafters, farmers, astisans, and ranchers seeking proof of quality and grade, thus allowing them to pull a higher price at market.
