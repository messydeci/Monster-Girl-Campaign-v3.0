<h2>
General Description
</h2>

<p>
Bavlo is a town known partially for its extensive network of well-designed and maintained roadways. The city's infrastructure also includes an underground sewer system and a series of wind-powered ground water pumps. In addition, the Bavlo Department of Infrastructure organizes and dispatches a sizeable force of patrols, watches, and technicians guards the travellers on the road, checks the road network and sewer system for damage, and occassionally sends armed groups into the nearby wilderness to root out known threats to travellers be they beast or bandit.
</p>

<p>
The Bavlo Department of Infrastructure also operates a series of toll booths, in cooperation with Bavlovian Quorum officials, which charge nominal fees for all beast- and wheel-based transit through and around the city, and also offer temporary business, sales, and trade licenses to travelling merchants. Most folks familiar with the difference between normal and Bavlovian roadways are willing to pay these small fees for the safety they provide.
