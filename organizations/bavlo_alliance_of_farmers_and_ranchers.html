<h2>
General Description
</h2>

<p>
By member count, the Bavlo Alliance of Farmers & Ranchers is the largest guild in Bavlo. The main roads leading out of town are covered in farming settlements, settlements occupied by guild members, for dozens of miles beyond the edge of Bavlo's tenative municipal border. The actual employee count for the Alliance's offices in Bavlo is relatively minimal, as much of the actual work involved in running the headquarters is simple clerical paperwork and written correspondence.
</p>

<p>
  B.A.F.R. works with the Appraiser's Union and multiple other local organizations, including the Bavlovian Quorum, to ensure fair prices, prevent profiteering, and assure its members have consistent access to good wages and large markets.
