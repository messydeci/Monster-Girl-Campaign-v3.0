<h1>
  Far Reach Shipping Guild
</h1>

<p>
  The Weeping Reaches, Bavlo, West Ward
</p>


<h2>
General Description
</h2>

<p>
Headquartered in the West Ward, near the center of the city of Bavlo, this main office of the Far Reach Shipping Guild oversees local and regional operations throughout the portions of the Weeping Reaches connected via water to the mega-lake far to the northeast of Bavlo.
</p>

<p>
  The complex of buildings that makes up the guild's headquarters holds an office, library, internal postal hub, a company vault, private guarded storage, and an entire array of smaller, connected annexes and facilities dedicated to the many miscellaneous functions of the guild. While the guild employs thousands across the entire Weeping Reaches, the headquarters in Bavlo employs only a few hundred Bavlovian locals to fulfill local operations.
  </p>

  <p>
    The F.R.S.G. has scores of branch offices in smaller settlements across the region, usually in strategically-located settlements meant to create more expedited routes for their couriers and clients.
  </p>

<p>
  Most of the F.R.S.G.'s shipping business takes place via the waterways of the region, though in some places, such as in Bavlo, they have developed localized infrastructure for the purpose of moving landlocked goods to nearby ports.
