<h2>
	General Description
</h2>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Goblin:</b> Small and fast, but weak and relatively repugnant, goblins form large portions of the regional alchemy industry. Known for their keen noses and their love of shiny things, most goblins are keen to use their skills, whatever they may be, to acquire the object/s of their desire.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		<b>Harp:</b> Historians, messengers, and natural linguists, harps are known for their mimicry and for the strength of their connections to the world trees of the region. Harps share a love of shiny baubles and trinkets with goblins and roder, and a love of storytelling with the tamarini and kitsune.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		<b>Kitsune:</b> Shapeshifting tricksters and charismatic entertainers make up the bulk of most kitsune populations. Though they occasionally seem to act without thought or reason, kitsune are generally an amiable folk, well-liked by their colleagues and neighbors. 
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		<b>Orrk'ari:</b> As the predecessors of one of the most feared and warlike races of ancient history, the modern orrk'ari maintain a position as good neighbors and fearsome foes. Orrk'ari have large populations dispersed and integrated throughout the Weeping Reaches.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		<b>Roder:</b> Hailing from the caverns under the ranges and peaks of the Weeping Reaches, roder have begun to make homes for themselves on the surface over the last few centuries. Natural alchemists and scrutinous business folk, roder share an obsession for shiny trinkets with goblins and harp.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		<b>Tamarini:</b> Energetic and sociable, the scattered tamarini populations of the Weeping Reaches are known as ubiquitous pranksters, and as the only other race to have a relationship with the regional world trees on par with that of harp communities. Less populous than most other races, tamarini nonetheless rarely pass through a settlement without leaving a distinct impression on its denizens.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		<b>Tiefling:</b> Tieflings are the descendants of abyssal entities long dead or otherwise banished from the Material Plane. These vaguely demonic-looking humanoids, being so long seperated from the source of their blood's innate magic, have had to redefine their connection to the world around them.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		<b>Varanidae:</b> Before the dawn of history as it is currently known, the ancestors of the varanidae lived in bonded harmony with the water-logged parts of the Weeping Reaches as hunter clans of apex predators indirectly ruling all life around them. Though they still interact with other races and settlements for purposes of trade and diplomacy, varanidae form largely private communities still practicing the same traditions of ages long past.
	</li>
</ul>
