  Varanidae

<h2>
  General Description:
</h2>

<p>
  Varanidae are proud and powerful reptilian humanoids that make their communal homes in locations set along rivers, large bodies of water, or within swamps or marshes. Uninterested in large scale settlement within the drier lands, many varanidae will nonetheless travel away from their home turf to engage in trade, only to return home with as much expedience as possible. Varanidae have little use for the fads, trends, and social customs of other races they interact with, and while this leads some to view them as gruff or curt, those who know the varanidae race a bit better understand that this is their version of efficient politeness. Varanidae are content with their own traditions and history, which stretch back further than most scholars are comfortable admitting.
  </p>

<p>
  Though powerful fighters, many varanidae set themselves on the path of the artisan, or place themselves in the service of a divine entity in the name of their clan or extended family unit. Their capabilities in the water have placed them as highly desirable workers when building any sort of bridge, dam, sewer, or underground construction near the water, and many clever varanidae crafters have brought prosperity to their family unit with their talents in these fields. 
</p>

<p>
  Across the world, the varanidae are known as an older people, supposedly keepers of hidden mysteries and knowledge that have never been commited to paper. In the Weeping Reaches region, talented varanidae oracles and shaman are invited to join the Endless Tale, a far-reaching circle of individuals who have commited their life to the survival of the oral history of the varanidae.

<h2>
  Physical Description:
</h2>

<p>
  Most varanidae stand six to seven feet tall, and weigh in excess of 200 pounds. Their thick-yet-streamlined muscles are typically covered in some combination of dark green, black, white, and gray scales. The varanidae of the Weeping Reaches region are known for their longer, pointed muzzles, and their "mane" of dorsal spikes extending from their ear pits to the tip of their thick, yard-long tail. Varanidae's eyes are universally one of several shades of gray, with occasional fleckings of color that match the dominant color of their scales.
