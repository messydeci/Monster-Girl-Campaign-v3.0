<h1>
  Lynix
</h1>

<p>
  Base: Catfolk
</p>

<h2>
  General Description:
</h2>

<p>
  Lynix are a race of natural explorers who rarely tire of trailblazing, but such trailblazing is not limited merely to the search for new horizons in distant lands. Many lynix see personal growth and development as equally valid avenues of exploration. Alone or in a group, for knowledge or personal gain, these cat-like humanoids are consistently willing to strike out at a new horizon, whether literal or metaphoric.
  </p>

  <p>
While most lynix are nimble, capable, and often active creatures, there is also a strong tendency among some lynix to engage in quiet contemplation and study. Such individuals tend to have a stronger-than-usual bond with their homeland and surrounding countryside, and will spend considerable time ranging, exploring, and getting to know specific locations within their homeland over the span of many years. Those individuals who form a particularly deep bond with the land will often find themselves approached by a member of the [NAME], lynix shifters acting as defenders of the beasts of the wilds and allies to any other groups dedicated to the protection of the natural world, such as the [Druids].
</p>

<p>
  Lynix are curious by nature, and lynix culture never discourages inquisitiveness, but rather fosters and encourages it. Many are seen as quirky extroverts by members of other races, but within lynix tribes there is no shame attached to minor peculiarities, eccentricities, or foolhardiness. As such, it is not uncommon for an adventuring lynix to return to their home settlement years, or even decades, after departing on a long journey, only to be greeted and welcomed by friends and family as if they had never left.
  </p>

<p>
   All but the most inwardly focused lynix enjoy being the center of attention, but not at the expense of their tribe, whether it’s the one the lynix are born into or the tribe they choose through the bonds of friendship with other creatures. Lynix tend to be both generous and loyal to their family and friends. While they are renound for their capacity to enjoy the finer luxuries in life, their wanderlust causes them to adopt a comparatively spartan lifestyle on the road, enjoying only what luxuries they can provide themselves on the road, and splurging on more decadent experiences upon entering a new town. One lynix may carry a detailed grooming and washing kit, while another might always travel with drink and smoke, but both will enter a new town willing to spend what coin they have to be wined, dined, cleaned, and pampered.
</p>

<h2>
  Physical Description:
</h2>

<p>
  In general, lynix are lithe and slender, standing midway between tieflings and orcs in stature. While clearly humanoid, they possess many feline features, including a coat of soft fine fur of warm yellows and browns, slit pupils, and a sleek, slender tail. Their ears are pointed, but unlike those of elves, are more rounded and catlike, with unique tufts of fur which grow behind the ears and protrude above them. Most lynix are fiercely proud of their ear tufts. Feline whiskers are not common, but not universal, and are usually shorter and more bristly than the whiskers of other feline humanoids. Some lynix, regardless of gender, have manes, which are usually a darker and redder shade than that of their fur. The eyes of most lynix are gold, though occasionally a green-, gray-, or blue-eyed child is born.
</p>

  <p>
   They manipulate objects as easily as any other humanoid, but their fingers terminate in small, sharp, retractable claws. These claws are typically not powerful enough to be used as weapons, but some members of the species—either by quirk of birth or from years of honing—can use them with deadly effect. Any lynix who shows aptitude in combat sports is generally sent to the [NAME] for training. 
 </p>

  <h2> 
  Society:
</h2>

<p>
  While self-expression is an important aspect of lynix culture, it is mitigated by a strong sense of community and group effort. In the wild, lynix are a hunter-gatherer tribal people. The pursuit of personal power never comes before the health and well-being of the tribe. More than one race has underestimated this seemingly gentle people only to discover much too late that their cohesion also provides them great strength.
</p>

  <p>
In isolation, lynix prefer to be led by their most competent members, usually a council of sub-chieftains chosen by their peers, either though consensus or election. The sub-chiefs then choose a chieftain to lead in times of danger and to mediate disputes among the sub-chiefs. The chieftain is the most capable member of the tribe, and is often magically talented.</p>

<p>
  Lynix who settle in more urban and civilized areas still cling to a similar tribal structure, but often see friends outside the tribe, even those from other races, as part of their extended tribe. Within adventuring groups, lynix who do not consider themselves the obvious choice as chieftain often defer to the person who most resembles their cultural ideal of a chieftain. Though this mentality can sometimes cause lynix adventurers to assume a haughty or aloof persona when dealing with individuals with whom they are not acquainted, most lynix are not hesitant to reassess their assumptions of someone after witnessing them avail themselves well of a sticky social or combat situation.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Relations:
  </h2>

  <p>
    Adaptable and curious, lynix get along with almost any race that extends reciprocal goodwill. They easily befriend vanara and kitsune, especially those who care to share their personal adventures from far-off lands. Though lynix find the historians and arcivists of the harp culture fascinating, the harp's natural distrust of lynix generally causes too much friction for real friendships to grow.</p>

    <p>
    While the sight and sound of goblins makes most lynix feel uneasy, lynix crafters and tradesmen heartily endores the quality of local goblin-made wares. Many tieflings share the lynix love of music, dancing, and storytelling. Though far less mischevious than some of the other charismatic races, most lynix will not balk at watching a harmless prank unfold, or at being the target of said pranks.</p>

    <p>
Some of the more aggressive races like lizardfolk and gnolls tend to put lynix on edge, especially in situations where people larger than them are behaving aggressively or intimidatingly. Trust between flightier lynix adventurers and such individuals can be forged, though it takes a considerable investment of time and patience.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Alignment & Religion:
  </h2>

  <p>
    With community and unselfish cooperation at the center of their culture, as well as a good-natured curiosity and willingness to adapt to the customs of many other races, most lynix tend toward good alignments. The clear majority of lynix are also chaotic, as wisdom is not their strongest virtue; nevertheless, there are exceptions with cause.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Adventurers:
  </h2>

  <p>
    Natural born trackers, the hunter-gatherer aspect of their tribes pushes many lynix toward occupations as rangers and hunters by default, but such roles don’t always speak to their love of performance art, be it song, dance, or storytelling. Lynix legends also speak of a rich tradition of great sorcerer heroes, which nearly any lynix showing magical potential attempts to emulate throughout their inevitable training.
    </p> 

<p>
    Those lynix with the patience to undertake long hours of study and practice can occasionally become wizards or monks, but most of the more duty-driven lynix choose to train under the Swiftsworn, a cultural organization of lynix ninjas dedicated to training its members to act as scouts, spies, and assassins. Lynix understand that exploration and self-knowledge can lead down many roads, and are accepting of nearly all professions and ways of life.
